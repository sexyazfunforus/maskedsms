## Setup a Twilio application
Before you can run this app you need to go into your account portal and [create a new Twilio Application](https://www.twilio.com/user/account/apps). Once you have created an app the urls should look like:

**Voice**: http://[your server].com/reservations/connect_voice

**SMS & MMS**: http://[your server].com/reservations/connect_sms

## Running the application

Clone this repository and cd into the directory then.

```
$ bundle install
$ rake db:create db:migrate
$ export TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=your account sid
$ export TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your auth token
$ export TWILIO_NUMBER=+16515559999
$ export ANONYMOUS_APPLICATION_SID=your application sid
$ rake test
$ rails server
```

Then visit the application at http://localhost:3000/
